# Planning from Specification (/sp.plan)

You have a clear, refined specification. Excellent. Now you need to answer: **How will we build this? What are the phases? What must happen first, what next, what last?**

A specification answers "What?" and "Why?" A plan answers "How?" and "When?"

`/sp.plan` takes your specification and generates an implementation plan: phases, dependencies, milestones, risks. This lesson shows you how to use it and understand the plans it produces.

The key insight: **Clear specifications produce clear plans with explicit dependencies. Vague specifications produce confusing plans with missing phases.**

## Part A: Understanding Plans

### Specification vs. Plan

| Specification | Plan |
|---|---|
| **Answers**: What to build? Why? | **Answers**: How to build? When? |
| **Describes**: Requirements, acceptance criteria, success measures | **Describes**: Phases, dependencies, milestones |
| **Purpose**: Contract with implementer | **Purpose**: Roadmap for development |
| **Audience**: Everyone (stakeholders, developers, AI) | **Audience**: Development team |
| **Length**: Typically 3-5 pages | **Length**: Typically 5-10 pages (more detailed) |

### Plan Structure

A complete plan has these sections:

#### **Phases: High-Level Steps**

Phases break the project into sequential or parallel work streams. Each phase has a purpose and produces deliverables (code, tests, documentation).

#### **Dependencies: Phase Ordering**

Dependencies define which phases must complete before others can start.

**Question**: Can you parallelize? For calculator:
- Phase 2 (core functions) and Phase 3 (error handling) could partially overlap
- But Phase 1 (architecture) must complete before anything else

#### **Milestones: Checkpoints**

Milestones mark "when" phases are done.

#### **Deliverables: What's Produced**

Each phase produces concrete outputs.

## Generate Plan with /sp.plan 

### Running the Command

Like `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan` runs **within AI Companion**:

1. Open AI Companion
2. Paste your refined specification (from Lesson 4)
3. Run 


**Your Prompt:**

```
/sp.plan

Create: architecture sketch, interfaces, data model, error handling, requirements.
Decisions needing: list important choices with options and tradeoffs.
Testing strategy: unit + integration tests based on acceptance criteria.

Technical details:
- Use a simple, functional approach where it makes sense
- Use Python 3.12+ type hints with | union syntax
- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implementation
- Organize code and tests according to your constitution rules
```

**Agent Does:**

- Creates technical implementation plan
- Defines data models and interfaces
- Establishes testing strategy
- Identifies architectural decisions
- Generates quick-start.md and plan.md files

**Why This Matters:**
The plan defines technical architecture for ALL operations at once. This ensures consistency - same type hints, same error handling, same testing approach. Much more efficient than planning each operation separately!

## Try With AI

**Tool**: Claude Code with `/sp.plan` command
**Duration**: 10 minutes

### Workflow

1. **Run `/sp.plan`** on your refined specification
2. **Review the generated plan**: Read all phases
3. **Ask Claude**: "What are the critical dependencies in this plan?"
4. **Ask Claude**: "Can I parallelize any phases? Which ones and why?"
5. **Trace a requirement**: "How does [requirement from spec] appear in the plan?"

### Expected Outcomes

- You see `/sp.plan` as a real planning tool, not a demo
- You understand how clear specifications produce clear plans
- You recognize dependencies and critical path
- You're ready for `/sp.tasks` (Lesson 6) with a solid plan
- You see the cascade in action: Spec quality → Plan quality
