## Response snapshot

**Phase 0: Load Design Documents** ✅ COMPLETED
- Ran `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` → Got FEATURE_DIR
- Read plan.md (1,688 lines) - Complete lesson-by-lesson breakdown with teaching tiers
- Read spec.md (481 lines) - 9 user stories with priorities, 20 success criteria, 8 evals
- Read tasks-template.md - Format rules and organization principles

**Phase 1: Task Generation Workflow** ✅ COMPLETED

Generated 79 tasks organized in 14 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup & Preparation (4 tasks)**
- T001-T004: Create structure, review existing content, verify Context7 access, review constitution

**Phase 2: Foundational Content (2 tasks)**
- T005-T006: Write chapter README with bridges from Part 1, add constitutional alignment note

**Phase 3-11: User Story Implementation (9 lesson phases, 43 tasks)**
- Each phase maps to one user story (US1-US9)
- Each lesson phase includes: write lesson content, add "Try with AI" section, add frontmatter, address edge cases
- Lessons structured as: Introduction → Core concepts (Tier 1) → AI collaboration (Tier 2) → Practice → Edge cases
- Examples:
  - **Phase 3 (US1)**: T007-T009 - Origin story lesson (paradigm shift comparison table, 7 examples, reflection prompts)
  - **Phase 4 (US2)**: T010-T014 - Installation lesson (direct commands all platforms, troubleshooting, security)
  - **Phase 7 (US5)**: T023-T026 - Hello World practice (4-prompt workflow, role clarity, edge cases)
  - **Phase 8 (US6)**: T027-T031 - CLAUDE.md creation (example structure, AI-assisted creation, auto-loading)

**Phase 12: Polish & Validation (11 tasks)**
- T048-T058: Format validation, constitutional alignment, cognitive load checks, duration verification, success criteria mapping

**Phase 13: Technical Validation (10 tasks)**
- T059-T068: Sandbox testing on all platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux), authentication flow, Hello World workflow, CLAUDE.md creation, commands verification, duration measurement

**Phase 14: Agent-Based Review (11 tasks)**
- T069-T079: Technical-reviewer agent invocation, proof-validator agent invocation, issue resolution (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR), final constitutional check, Docusaurus build test

**Key Task Generation Principles Applied**:
1. **Organized by User Story**: Each lesson (US1-US9) is independently completable
2. **Strict Checklist Format**: All tasks follow `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`
3. **Parallel Opportunities**: Marked with [P] tag - conceptual lessons can run in parallel, technical lessons can run in parallel
4. **Anti-Over-Engineering**: Installation (T010) documented as direct commands, not AI wrapper
5. **Graduated Teaching**: Each lesson task includes Tier 1/2/3 teaching strategy
6. **Constitutional Alignment**: Tasks T048-T058 validate Principles 13, 18, cognitive load limits
7. **Success Criteria Mapping**: Every task maps to specific SC-001 to SC-020 and Evals 1-8

**Phase 2: Generate tasks.md** ✅ COMPLETED

Created `specs/018-chapter-5-claude-code-rework/tasks.md` (680 lines) with:
- 79 tasks in 14 phases
- All tasks follow strict format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- Dependencies section showing phase and lesson completion order
- Parallel execution examples for conceptual lessons and technical lessons
- Implementation strategy: MVP first (Lessons 1, 2, 5), then incremental (P1 → P2 → P3), then parallel team
- Success Criteria Validation table mapping 79 tasks to all 20 SC + 8 Evals
- Policy note for lesson authors: Each lesson ends with "Try With AI" section only (no "Key Takeaways")

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated comprehensive 79-task checklist for Chapter 5 rework, organized by 9 user stories, with parallel opportunities, constitutional validation, and sandbox testing requirements built-in
- 🧪 Tests: Task validation checklist 100% passed (all tasks follow format, all user stories covered, all success criteria mapped)
- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/018-chapter-5-claude-code-rework/tasks.md` (680 lines, 79 tasks)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin Phase 4 (Implementation) - invoke lesson-writer agent for individual lessons, or proceed sequentially: Lesson 1 (T007-T009) → Lesson 2 (T010-T014) → ... → Lesson 9 (T042-T047)
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation demonstrates strong organization (14 phases, 9 user stories clearly mapped). Parallel opportunities identified for both conceptual lessons (1, 3, 4, 8, 9) and technical lessons (2, 5, 6, 7). Anti-over-engineering validated (T052). Constitutional alignment checks built into Phase 12-14. Ready for content implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all validation items passed on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: Task format validation (all 79 tasks follow `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description` format)
  - ✅ PASS: User story coverage (all 9 user stories US1-US9 have complete task phases)
  - ✅ PASS: Success criteria mapping (all 20 SC + 8 Evals mapped to specific tasks)
  - ✅ PASS: Constitutional alignment check (Principles 13, 18 enforcement in T048-T057)
  - ✅ PASS: Anti-over-engineering check (T052 validates direct commands for installation)
  - ✅ PASS: Parallel opportunities identified (conceptual lessons + technical lessons tagged [P])
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - standard /sp.tasks workflow with educational content structure
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to Phase 4 (Implementation). Recommended approach: Start with MVP (Lessons 1, 2, 5) to validate lesson-writing workflow before scaling to all 9 lessons.
