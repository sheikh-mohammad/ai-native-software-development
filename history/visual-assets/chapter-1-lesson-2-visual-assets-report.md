## Identified Visual Opportunities

### VISUAL ASSET 1: Developer Economy Calculation Dashboard
- **Type**: Calculation Flow Diagram
- **Location**: Line 63 (after "Here's the math, laid out transparently:")
- **Content**: 30M developers × $100K value/year = $3T economy calculation
- **Purpose**: Make the fundamental economic calculation immediately graspable through visual flow
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Transforms abstract multiplication into concrete visual flow with three connected cards showing inputs and output

### VISUAL ASSET 2: Global Developer Economy GDP Comparison
- **Type**: Bar Chart Comparison
- **Location**: Line 180 (after "To put this in perspective:")
- **Content**: $3T developer economy compared to France GDP, India GDP, 40% of China GDP, and Canada GDP (doubled)
- **Purpose**: Provide relatable scale context by comparing to familiar national economies
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Dense text comparisons (France, India, China, Canada) become instantly scannable visual hierarchy showing relative scale

### VISUAL ASSET 3: Technology Adoption Speed Comparison Timeline
- **Type**: Horizontal Timeline with Descending Bars
- **Location**: Line 307 (after "And they're doing it **fast**.")
- **Content**: PC (12 years), Internet (10 years), Cloud (15 years), Mobile (8 years), AI Coding (3 years)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate exponential acceleration pattern across five technology waves
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Sequential bullet list becomes compelling descending staircase visual showing acceleration trend at a glance

## Audit Summary

**High-Priority Assets**: 3
**Medium-Priority Assets**: 0
**Skipped Opportunities**: 2 (single statistics, narrative examples better in text)

**Overall Assessment**: This lesson contains dense economic data that benefits significantly from visualization. The three selected visuals target the core comprehension challenges: understanding the calculation, grasping the scale, and seeing the acceleration pattern. Visual density is appropriate for content complexity.
