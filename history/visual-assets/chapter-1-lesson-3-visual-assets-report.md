## Identified Visual Opportunities

### VISUAL ASSET 1: Technology Adoption Speed Comparison Chart
- **Type**: Grouped Horizontal Bar Chart
- **Location**: Line 123 (after "The timeline for AI coding adoption is unprecedented:")
- **Content**: Adoption speed comparison across 4 technology shifts - Internet (8y/15y), Cloud (10y/18y), Mobile (6y/12y), AI Coding (2y/3y projected) showing 50% and 80%+ adoption milestones
- **Purpose**: Visualize the unprecedented acceleration of AI coding adoption compared to historical technology transitions
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Data table with 8 numbers becomes instantly comparable visual showing dramatic acceleration pattern with AI bars 3-5x shorter than others

## Audit Summary

**High-Priority Assets**: 1
**Medium-Priority Assets**: 0
**Skipped Opportunities**: 3 (external disruption narrative examples, universal impact bullet list, recursion effect abstract concept - all work better in text format)

**Overall Assessment**: This lesson is heavily conceptual with narrative explanations. The single high-priority visual opportunity (adoption timeline comparison) was identified because it contains dense tabular data that benefits from visual comparison. Other content sections are better served by text explanations rather than visualization.
