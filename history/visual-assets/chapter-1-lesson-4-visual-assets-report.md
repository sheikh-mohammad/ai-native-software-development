## Identified Visual Opportunities

### VISUAL ASSET 1: Development Lifecycle Transformation Diagram
- **Type**: Dual-Track Process Flow Diagram
- **Location**: Line 65 (after "Let's establish a baseline.")
- **Content**: Six-phase development lifecycle (Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Operations) shown in traditional specialist-role format (top track) versus AI-augmented individual+AI format (bottom track) with transformation arrows
- **Purpose**: Visualize the systemic transformation across all development phases, showing role convergence and AI integration at every stage
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Abstract lifecycle concept with six phases and multiple role transformations becomes concrete visual showing parallel tracks with transformation arrows, making the "every phase" claim immediately graspable

## Audit Summary

**High-Priority Assets**: 1
**Medium-Priority Assets**: 0
**Skipped Opportunities**: 3 (individual phase narrative comparisons work well in text, compounding effect is abstract concept, role transformation discussion is conceptual)

**Overall Assessment**: This lesson focuses on systemic transformation across the development lifecycle. The single high-priority visual (lifecycle transformation diagram) captures the core message effectively: AI transforms ALL phases simultaneously, not just code writing. Individual phase details work better as text with specific examples and comparisons.
