**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Lesson**: Beyond Code: The Changing Role of Developers
**Total Opportunities Identified**: 0
**Prompts Generated**: 0
**Visual Density**: 0 visuals (narrative-focused lesson)

## Identified Visual Opportunities

None identified. This lesson is primarily narrative and conceptual, focusing on the transformation from "typist" to "orchestrator" role. The four dimensions of the orchestrator role and seniority level transformations are best conveyed through text explanations with specific examples rather than visualizations.

## Audit Summary

**High-Priority Assets**: 0
**Medium-Priority Assets**: 0
**Skipped Opportunities**: Multiple (role transformation narrative, four orchestrator dimensions, seniority level examples - all work better as narrative text with code examples)

**Overall Assessment**: This lesson is conceptual and introspective, focusing on personal role transformation. The content is inherently narrative and benefits more from storytelling, code examples, and reflective prompts than from data visualizations. No visual assets needed.
