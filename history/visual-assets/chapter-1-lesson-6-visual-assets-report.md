## Identified Visual Opportunities

### VISUAL ASSET 1: AI Coding Tools Evolution Timeline
- **Type**: Vertical Timeline with Generation Cards
- **Location**: Line 63 (after "Let's trace the progression over the past few years:")
- **Content**: Four-generation evolution (Gen 1: Autocomplete 2021-22, Gen 2: Function Generation 2022-23, Gen 3: Feature Implementation 2023-24, Gen 4: Autonomous Agents 2024-25) with capability descriptions, examples, limitations, paradigms, and autonomy meter showing 20%-40%-70%-90% progression
- **Purpose**: Visualize the rapid evolution of AI coding tools from simple autocomplete to autonomous agents, showing increasing autonomy and capability
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Cognitive Load Impact**: REDUCES - Four text sections with multiple attributes each (capability, examples, limitations, paradigms) become scannable vertical progression with visual hierarchy and autonomy meter, making evolution pattern and "we are here" transition point immediately graspable

## Audit Summary

**High-Priority Assets**: 1
**Medium-Priority Assets**: 0
**Skipped Opportunities**: 2 (agent capability lists, workflow comparison - both work well in text format)

**Overall Assessment**: This lesson explains the evolution of AI tools across four generations. The single high-priority visual (evolution timeline) effectively captures the progression and current transition phase. Other content sections (detailed capability lists, workflow comparisons) work better as text with specific examples.
