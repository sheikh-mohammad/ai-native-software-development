# Visual Asset Audit - Chapter 1, Lesson 8

**Date**: 2025-01-12
**Lesson**: Why Traditional CS Education Falls Short
**Total Opportunities Identified**: 0
**Prompts Generated**: 0
**Visual Density**: 0 visuals (narrative-focused lesson)

## Identified Visual Opportunities

None high-priority. While there's a curriculum lag comparison (2-4 year university revision vs 3-6 month AI evolution), this concept works well in text format as presented. The lesson is focused on education gaps and learning strategy, which benefit from narrative explanation rather than visualization.

## Audit Summary

**High-Priority Assets**: 0
**Medium-Priority Assets**: 0
**Skipped Opportunities**: 2 (curriculum lag timeline, education gaps list - both work adequately in text, would not significantly reduce cognitive load if visualized)

**Overall Assessment**: This lesson critiques traditional CS education and identifies skill gaps. The content is argumentative and strategic, best conveyed through narrative with specific examples (mobile development historical case). No high-priority visual opportunities that would meaningfully reduce cognitive load.
