## Constitutional Alignment

### Principle 13: Graduated Teaching Pattern

| Lesson | Tier 1 (Book) | Tier 2 (AI) | Tier 3 (Orchestration) | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | Paradigm definition | Self-analysis | - | ✅ Explicit |
| 2 | Direct commands | Troubleshoot | - | ✅ Explicit |
| 3 | Explain concepts | Understand when | Introduce orchestration | ✅ Explicit |
| 4 | Explain Skills/MCP | Exploration examples | Custom skills defer | ✅ Explicit |
| 5 | Workflow template | Execute with AI | - | ✅ Explicit |

**Assessment**: All 9 lessons clearly map Tier 1/2/3 teaching boundaries with explicit deferral of advanced content to Part 5/6

### Principle 18: Three Roles Framework

| Lesson | AI as Teacher | AI as Student | AI as Co-Worker | Status |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | Explains paradigm | Learns student's workflow | - | ✅ Integrated |
| 2 | (Book teaches) | Learns install preferences | Troubleshoots | ✅ Integrated |
| 3 | Explains subagents | Learns task preferences | - | ✅ Integrated |
| 4 | Explains MCP | Learns integration needs | - | ✅ Integrated |
| 5 | Explains patterns | Learns student style | Executes with approval | ✅ Integrated |
| 6 | Generates CLAUDE.md | Learns project details | Creates in collaboration | ✅ Integrated |
| 7 | Explains permissions | - | - | ✅ Integrated |
| 8 | Suggests hooks | Learns workflow patterns | - | ✅ Integrated |
| 9 | Explains hierarchy | - | - | ✅ Integrated |

**Assessment**: All lessons demonstrate bidirectional AI learning and appropriate role assignment

### Core Philosophy #1: AI Development Spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native)

| Lesson | Assisted | Driven | Native | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Passive AI vs agentic | Specification mindset | - | ✅ Explicit contrast |
| 2 | Manual commands | Direct tool integration | - | ✅ Direct approach |
| 3 | - | Plan-based execution | Introduce orchestration | ✅ Future preview |
| 4 | - | Tool integration | Extensibility introduced | ✅ Future context |
| 5 | - | Specify → execute → verify | - | ✅ Core pattern |
| 6-9 | - | Foundational practices | Mentioned as future | ✅ Appropriate tier |

**Assessment**: Chapter shows progression from passive (ChatGPT web) to driven (Claude Code spec-based) with native orchestration introduced as future capability

### Anti-Over-Engineering Enforcement

- [x] **Installation is direct**: `curl | bash`, `npm install` — NOT "ask AI to install"
- [x] **Simple operations not wrapped in AI**: Version check, auth, basic commands run directly
- [x] **"Try with AI" format**: Chapter 1 clean style (3-4 focused prompts per lesson max)
- [x] **No verbose explanations**: Lesson structure is action-oriented, not tutorial-heavy
- [x] **Duration realism**: Installation 2-5 min (not 45 min), auth 1-2 min, test 1 min
- [x] **Boundary clarity**: When to use Claude Code directly vs when to ask for help

**Assessment**: All 9 lessons strictly enforce anti-over-engineering patterns; no bloat, no unnecessary AI wrapping
