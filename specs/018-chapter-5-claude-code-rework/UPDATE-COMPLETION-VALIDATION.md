## 🔄 What This Update Accomplished

### Before (Incomplete):
- Lesson 4: "Skills and MCP Integration" (6-8 min)
- Brief mentions of skills and MCP
- No plugin architecture coverage
- No hands-on plugin installation
- 3 acceptance scenarios
- Generic "appreciate extensibility" goal

### After (Comprehensive):
- Lesson 4: "Skills, Plugins, and MCP Integration" (10-12 min)
- Complete extensibility architecture
- Agent skills with progressive disclosure pattern
- Plugin system with installation workflow
- MCP integration with JSON structure
- Relationship hierarchy with visual diagram
- Hands-on plugin installation practice
- 10 acceptance scenarios
- Specific "personalize your AI companion for AIDD" goal

## 🎓 Pedagogical Transformation

**From**: Passive awareness ("skills exist, plugins exist")
**To**: Active personalization ("install plugins, understand architecture, customize your AI companion")

**Key Additions**:
1. **Progressive Disclosure Pattern**: 3-level architecture explained
2. **SKILL.md Structure**: YAML frontmatter + markdown + bundled files
3. **PDF Skill Example**: Concrete form filling + Python script execution
4. **Plugin Architecture**: .claude-plugin/plugin.json manifest + components
5. **Installation Workflow**: `/plugin` → marketplace → install → restart → verify
6. **Community Ecosystem**: anthropics/claude-code, Dan Ávila, Seth Hobson
7. **MCP Configuration**: JSON structure with GitHub/Filesystem examples
8. **Relationship Hierarchy**: Visual diagram showing container relationships
9. **Hands-On Practice**: Real plugin installation with verification
10. **AIDD Personalization**: Emphasis on customizing AI companion for workflows

## 🏛️ Constitutional Alignment

**Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching)**:
- Tier 1 (Book): Teaches architecture (progressive disclosure, plugin structure, MCP JSON)
- Tier 2 (AI Companion): Helps explore (marketplace browsing, installation assistance)
- Tier 3 (AI Orchestration): Custom development deferred to Part 5/6

**Principle 18 (Three Roles)**:
- AI as Teacher: Explains progressive disclosure, plugin architecture
- AI as Student: Learns student preferences through marketplace exploration
- AI as Co-Worker: Assists with plugin installation, troubleshoots errors

**Cognitive Load (A2)**:
- Lesson 4 concepts: Skills (1), Progressive Disclosure (2), Plugins (3), MCP (4), Hierarchy (5), Community Ecosystem (6), Personalization (7) = 7 concepts ✓
- Within A2 limit of 7 concepts per section
