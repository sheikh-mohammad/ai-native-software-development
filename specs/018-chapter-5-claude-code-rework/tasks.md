  - How MCP configs fit inside plugins (plugins can contain .mcp.json files bundling external integrations)

- [ ] T022 [P] [US4] Write Lesson 4 Relationship Hierarchy section (04-skills-plugins-mcp.md):
  - Visual ASCII diagram showing: Plugins (containers) → contain → [Skills + Commands + Agents + Hooks + MCP]
  - Skills distinction: autonomous capabilities (Claude decides when to invoke based on task context)
  - Commands distinction: user-invoked slash commands (like `/plugin`, `/code-review`, `/feature-dev`)
  - Agents distinction: specialized subagents (Explore for codebase search, Plan mode for multi-step tasks)
  - Hooks distinction: event-triggered automation (PreToolUse validation, PostToolUse linting, SessionStart env loading)
  - MCP distinction: external integrations (GitHub, Filesystem, Google Drive, Jira, Slack, etc.)
  - Clear hierarchy explanation: Plugins are broadest container; Skills are one autonomous component among many

- [ ] T023 [US4] Add "Try With AI" section to 04-skills-plugins-mcp.md (4 prompts, includes hands-on plugin installation):
  - Prompt 1: Explore Plugins (`claude "/plugin"` → browse marketplace, see available plugins, understand installation options)
  - Prompt 2: Understand Skills Architecture (`claude "Explain agent skills in Claude Code. What is progressive disclosure? Give me the PDF skill example showing the 3 levels: metadata, core content, and referenced files."`)
  - Prompt 3: Install Example Plugin - HANDS-ON (`claude "/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code"` → wait for confirmation → `claude "/plugin install feature-dev"` → wait for download → restart Claude Code → verify with `claude "/help"` showing new `/feature-dev` command)
  - Prompt 4: Plan Custom Plugin (`claude "If I wanted to create a [React/FastAPI/Django] plugin with shortcuts for [common workflow tasks], what would I include? Commands? Agents? Skills? Hooks? Give me the plugin.json structure."`)

- [ ] T024 [US4] Add SKILL.md Example to 04-skills-plugins-mcp.md:

  - Example with name: "pdf", description: "Manipulate PDF files - fill forms, extract fields, read content"
  - Markdown instructional content explaining capabilities
  - Reference to bundled Python script (pdf_parser.py) for deterministic field extraction
  - 3-level progressive disclosure annotation (Level 1: YAML loaded to system prompt, Level 2: full SKILL.md when PDF task detected, Level 3: pdf_parser.py loaded only when form extraction needed)

- [ ] T025 [US4] Add Plugin Architecture Diagram to 04-skills-plugins-mcp.md:

  - `title: "Skills, Plugins, and MCP Integration"` (updated title from "Skills and MCP Integration")
  - `duration: "10-12 min"` (updated duration from "6-8 min" to reflect hands-on plugin installation)

- [ ] T027 [US4] Add Edge Cases section to 04-skills-plugins-mcp.md:
  - Confusion between Skills/Plugins/MCP (with clear hierarchy explanation and visual diagram reference)
  - Plugin installation failures (network issues: check internet; permissions errors: may need sudo; restart not performed: plugins activate after restart)
  - Marketplace not accessible (firewall blocking: corporate networks; no plugins available: need to run `/plugin marketplace add <url>` first; custom marketplace: teams can host private with extraKnownMarketplaces)
  - Expectation of building custom skills/plugins now (redirect to Part 5/6: Chapters 32-33 for plugins, Chapter 39 for MCP servers; reassurance: focus on understanding and installing existing plugins for AIDD personalization)
  - Overwhelm from too many concepts (simplification: "Plugins are app stores, Skills are apps that run automatically, MCP connects external tools"; hands-on reduces cognitive load)

**Checkpoint**: Lesson 4 complete. Maps to SC-005 (skills progressive disclosure), SC-006 (plugin installation hands-on), SC-007 (relationship hierarchy), SC-008 (MCP configuration), Eval 8 (Skills and Plugins Personalization).

  - Python Not Installed (error message, defer to later chapter, suggest alternative)
  - Module Import Error (collaborate with Claude: "I got this error—what's wrong?")
  - Overwhelm by Options (guidance: focus on WORKFLOW, not code syntax details)

- [ ] T026 [US5] Add frontmatter to 05-hello-world-practice.md:
  - `sidebar_position: 5`
  - `title: "Hello World Practice"`

### Implementation for User Story 9

- [ ] T042 [P] [US9] Write Lesson 9 (09-settings-hierarchy.md) with sections:
  - Settings Concept: Configuration files customize Claude Code behavior
  - Hierarchy Levels: User (~/.claude/settings.json), Project (.claude/settings.json), Local (.claude/settings.local.json)
  - Precedence Order: Local > Project > User (more specific overrides general)
  - Why It Matters: Team collaboration, personal customization, project safety
  - Not Configuring Now: Detailed configuration Part 5

- [ ] T043 [US9] Add Hierarchy Visualization:
  - Tree diagram showing USER LEVEL → PROJECT LEVEL → LOCAL LEVEL
  - For each: file path, applies to (scope), examples

- [ ] T056 Verify all edge cases addressed in appropriate lessons
- [ ] T057 Check all frontmatter correct (sidebar_position, title, duration)
- [ ] T058 Validate all user stories (US1-US9) have complete lessons with acceptance scenarios covered

**Checkpoint**: Content ready for technical review (Phase 13).

---

## Phase 13: Technical Validation (Sandbox Testing)

**Purpose**: Sandbox verification of all installation/authentication/workflow commands

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: All commands must be tested before publication

- [ ] T059 Test installation on macOS: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` → verify `claude --version` works
- [ ] T060 Test installation on Linux: Same curl command → verify works
- [ ] T061 Test installation on Windows: PowerShell script → verify works
- [ ] T062 Test NPM fallback: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` → verify works on all platforms
- [ ] T063 Test authentication flow: Run `claude` → verify OAuth prompt appears → complete auth → verify test command
- [ ] T064 Test Hello World workflow (Lesson 5): Execute all 4 prompts → verify outputs match expected
- [ ] T065 Test CLAUDE.md creation (Lesson 6): Generate with AI → verify file created → restart session → verify auto-load
- [ ] T066 Test permissions command (Lesson 7): Run `/permissions` → verify output
- [ ] T067 Verify all troubleshooting solutions work: Test common errors → apply solutions → verify fixes
- [ ] T068 Measure actual durations: Time each lesson hands-on portions → verify within 20% of estimates
- [ ] T068A Test plugin installation workflow in sandbox:
  - Run `/plugin` → verify marketplace browser appears
  - Run `/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code` → verify success message
  - Run `/plugin install feature-dev` → verify download/install
  - Restart Claude Code → verify plugin activated
  - Run `/help` → verify new commands appear (e.g., `/feature-dev`)
  - Document any errors or issues encountered

**Checkpoint**: All technical validation passed. Ready for technical review agent.

---

## Phase 14: Agent-Based Review & Finalization

**Purpose**: Invoke technical-reviewer and proof-validator agents for comprehensive quality check

- [ ] T069 Invoke technical-reviewer agent for Chapter 5:
  - Check technical correctness (all Claude Code features accurate)
  - Verify code examples run (installation commands, workflows)
  - Validate pedagogical effectiveness (learning objectives met)
  - Check constitution alignment (Principles 13, 18, cognitive load)
  - Generate validation report

- [ ] T070 Address all CRITICAL issues from technical-reviewer (blocking publication)
- [ ] T071 Address all MAJOR issues from technical-reviewer (important but not blocking)
- [ ] T072 Review MINOR issues from technical-reviewer (nice-to-have improvements)

- [ ] T073 Invoke proof-validator agent for Chapter 5:
  - Verify factual accuracy (all claims against official docs)
  - Check against source materials (constitution, chapter-index, Context7 docs)
  - Cross-reference citations
  - Validate lesson flow and coherence

- [ ] T074 Address all HIGH priority proof-validator findings
- [ ] T075 Address MEDIUM priority proof-validator findings
- [ ] T076 Review LOW priority proof-validator findings

- [ ] T077 Final constitutional alignment check:
  - Principle 13 (Graduated Teaching): ✓ across all 9 lessons
  - Principle 18 (Three Roles): ✓ across all 9 lessons
  - Core Philosophy #1 (AI Spectrum): ✓ Lesson 1 + Lesson 5
  - Cognitive Load (A2): ✓ max 7 concepts per section in all lessons
  - Anti-Over-Engineering: ✓ Lesson 2 direct commands, Chapter 1 format throughout

- [ ] T078 Run Docusaurus build test: Verify chapter renders correctly in book site
- [ ] T079 Create final validation report summarizing all checks passed

**Checkpoint**: Chapter 5 fully validated and ready for publication.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - creates README first
- **User Stories (Phases 3-11)**: All depend on Foundational (README) completion
  - Lessons 1-9 can then proceed in parallel (if multiple writers)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: P1 (Lessons 1, 2, 6) → P2 (Lessons 3, 5, 7) → P3 (Lessons 4, 8, 9)
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all 9 lessons being complete
- **Sandbox Testing (Phase 13)**: Depends on lessons with technical commands (Lessons 2, 5, 6, 7)
- **Agent Review (Phase 14)**: Depends on all content complete and sandbox tested

### Lesson Dependencies

**No Cross-Lesson Dependencies**: Each lesson is independently complete (Graduated Teaching applied within each)

- Lesson 1 (US1): No dependencies - introduces paradigm
- Lesson 2 (US2): No dependencies - installation stands alone
- Lesson 3 (US3): Conceptually builds on Lesson 1 (paradigm) but independently complete
- Lesson 4 (US4): Conceptually builds on Lesson 1 (paradigm) but independently complete
- Lesson 5 (US5): Requires Lesson 2 (Claude Code installed) - hands-on practice
- Lesson 6 (US6): Requires Lesson 2 (Claude Code installed) - creates CLAUDE.md
- Lesson 7 (US7): Conceptually builds on Lesson 2 (authentication/usage) but independently complete
- Lesson 8 (US8): Conceptually builds on Lesson 1 (paradigm) but independently complete
- Lesson 9 (US9): Conceptually builds on Lesson 2 (installation/usage) but independently complete

### Within Each Lesson

Standard lesson structure:
1. Introduction/Hook (why this matters)
2. Core concepts (Tier 1: book teaches)
3. AI collaboration (Tier 2: AI companion helps)
4. Practice (Try with AI section)
5. Edge cases/troubleshooting (where applicable)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1**: All setup tasks (T001-T004) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3-11**: All lessons can be written in parallel by different writers (after Phase 2 complete)
  - Lessons 1, 3, 4, 8, 9 (conceptual) can run in parallel
  - Lessons 2, 5, 6, 7 (technical/hands-on) can run in parallel
- **Phase 12**: All validation checks (T048-T058) can run in parallel
- **Phase 13**: Platform testing (T059-T062) can run in parallel
- **Phase 14**: Technical review and proof validation can run concurrently

## Parallel Example: All Conceptual Lessons

```bash
# Launch all conceptual lessons together (after Phase 2 README complete):
Task: "Write Lesson 1 (origin-story.md)" [US1]
Task: "Write Lesson 3 (subagents-and-orchestration.md)" [US3]
Task: "Write Lesson 4 (skills-and-mcp.md)" [US4]
Task: "Write Lesson 8 (hooks-and-extensibility.md)" [US8]
Task: "Write Lesson 9 (settings-hierarchy.md)" [US9]

# Launch all technical lessons together:
Task: "Write Lesson 2 (installation-and-authentication.md)" [US2]
Task: "Write Lesson 5 (hello-world-practice.md)" [US5]
Task: "Write Lesson 6 (claude-md-context-files.md)" [US6]
Task: "Write Lesson 7 (permission-management.md)" [US7]
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Essential Lessons Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: README (Foundation)
3. Complete Phase 3: Lesson 1 (Paradigm - P1) → **STOP and VALIDATE**
4. Complete Phase 4: Lesson 2 (Installation - P1) → **STOP and VALIDATE**
5. Complete Phase 7: Lesson 5 (Hello World - P2) → **STOP and VALIDATE**
6. Test MVP (3 lessons): Paradigm → Installation → Practice
7. If MVP validates successfully, proceed to remaining 6 lessons

### Incremental Delivery (Priority Order)

1. P1 Lessons (Foundation): 1, 2, 6 → Essential core
2. P2 Lessons (Important): 3, 5, 7 → Expands understanding
3. P3 Lessons (Advanced Awareness): 4, 8, 9 → Prepares for Part 5/6

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple content writers:

1. Writer A: P1 Lessons (1, 2, 6) - Foundation and Practice
2. Writer B: P2 Lessons (3, 5, 7) - Concepts and Safety
3. Writer C: P3 Lessons (4, 8, 9) - Advanced Awareness

All proceed after Phase 2 (README) complete.

## Notes

- **Policy for Lesson Authors**: Within Chapter 5, each lesson ends with single "Try With AI" section (no "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next"). Format: `### Prompt N: Title` → code block → `**Expected outcome:**` description.
- **[P] tasks**: Different lessons/files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability (US1 = Lesson 1, US2 = Lesson 2, etc.)
- **Each lesson**: Independently complete and testable
- **Anti-over-engineering check**: Installation (Lesson 2) must be direct commands, not "use AI to install"
- **Graduated Teaching**: Tier 1 (book teaches) → Tier 2 (AI companion) → Tier 3 (orchestration intro) enforced per lesson
- **Commit frequently**: After each lesson completion or logical group
- **Stop at checkpoints**: Validate lessons independently before proceeding
- **Constitutional alignment**: Every lesson must align with Principles 13, 18, Core Philosophy #1, cognitive load A2 limits
